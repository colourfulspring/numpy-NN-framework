# numpy-NN-framework: A simple neural network framework.

## Introduction
This is a simple neural framework, which supports forward and backward propagation. Currently, you can build a neural network consists of Linear Layer, Pow Layer, Tanh and Sigmoid activation function and Substract Layer. Each of them can be used for unlimited times.

## Features
* Pytorch-like API
* Dynamic Computational Graph
* Based on Numpy 

## Example
You can run example.py to see example.

**Make sure that Numpy is installed before run!**
