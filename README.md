## A simple neural network framework.
This is a simple neural framework implemented by Numpy, which supports forward and backward propagation. Currently, you can build a simple neural network consists of Linear Layer, Pow Layer, Tanh and Sigmoid activation function and Substract Layer.

You can run example.py to see example.
